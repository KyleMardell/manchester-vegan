This quiet corner of Greater Manchester played a surprisingly big role in shaping the vegetarian and even vegan values we know now.</p><p>If you're vegan or vegetarian and living in Manchester, or you're just interested in the backstory of your plant-based lifestyle, this is one bit of local history you’ll definitely want to know about.</p>"

This wasn’t your average church. The Bible Christians believed in:</p><ul><li>Free will and spiritual freedom</li><li>Education and equality</li><li>Living a life of kindness and compassion</li><li>Avoiding alcohol</li><li>And — most notably — abstaining from meat</li></ul><p>Cowherd preached that it was a Christian duty to show mercy to animals, and that eating them wasn’t in line with a compassionate or moral life. His message was surprisingly modern, and even more surprising — people listened.</p><p>He once said: \"If God had meant us to eat meat, it would have come to us in edible form — as is the ripened fruit.\"</p><p>At a time when meat was a staple and the idea of vegetarianism was almost unheard of in Britain, this was a pretty revolutionary statement.</p>"

Cowherd encouraged his congregation to not only avoid meat but also think more broadly about how they treated all living beings.</p><p>This small but passionate community in Salford effectively became one of the first organized vegetarian groups in the Western world.</p><p>Their meat-free, alcohol-free lifestyle wasn’t just about personal health either — it was tied deeply to moral and spiritual values, and a desire to live gently and fairly in a world that, frankly, wasn’t doing a great job at either.</p>"

One of the most notable was Joseph Brotherton, a former church member who went on to become Salford’s first MP. He remained vegetarian for life and pushed the message in Parliament and beyond.</p><p>A few decades later, in 1847, the Vegetarian Society was officially formed. Although it was technically founded in Ramsgate, Kent, many of its early leaders were either directly influenced by Cowherd’s teachings or were from the Manchester and Salford area.</p><p>This makes Greater Manchester one of the true birthplaces of organized vegetarianism in the West.</p>"
